# Java Data Structures
### Alexander J. Habegger

This repository contains a collection of implementations of various data structures in Java. It is intended as a resource for learners and developers who wish to understand the inner workings of fundamental data structures in computer science.

## Data Structures Included
- **Tree:** A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes.
- **Graph:** A set of nodes connected by edges.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/ahabegger/Java-Data-Structures.git

## Usage
Each data structure is implemented in its own Java file. You can include these files in your Java project to utilize the data structures or study and modify them to understand their implementation.

## Disclaimer
This project is part of an academic exercise and is not intended for commercial use.
